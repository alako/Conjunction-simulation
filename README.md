# Simulation Code for "Reasoning Without the Conjunction Closure"

This repository contains the code for the simulation discussed in the paper titled "Reasoning Without the Conjunction Closure," published in Episteme. The paper can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/reasoning-without-the-conjunction-closure/689B5C92CDA8E50175C0F1C6934EC831).

## Overview

The code provided here corresponds to the simulation described in the aforementioned paper. It aims to reproduce and experiment with the concepts and findings presented in the research.


## Usage
Assuming that you have already installed Jupyter Notebook on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alako/Conjunction-simulation.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```
  cd Conjunction-simulation
  ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

  ```
  jupyter notebook conjunction_closure.ipynb
  ```
  This will open the notebook in your default web browser.

  
4. Run the notebook cells:

  Execute each cell in the notebook to run the simulation.


5. Review the results:

  Examine the output and analysis within the notebook to understand the simulation results.
  
  Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the notebook.
